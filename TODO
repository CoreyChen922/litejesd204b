- cleanup clock domains names on TX, find best place to do CDC on Data
- fix CSR CDC on phy (on enable and mux)
- compare GTX parameters with reference design from Xilinx.
- fix Align Inserter model (or implementation?)
- test implementation, optimize ressources (?), optimize timings (? core should run @312.5MHz
- find SPI configuration for our design (map lanes correctly for KC705)
- test phy on board with ADI prbs checker up to 12.5Gbps.
- test link establishment with ADI device and ILAS (reponse to SYNC and specific registers for ILAS)
- test samples mapping to lanes with short test pattern and specific registers on ADI chip
- integrate with ARTIQ's phaser and test it
