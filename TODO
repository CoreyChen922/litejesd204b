- implement control characters correctly in model
- find best data with/frequency compromise for our design (but try to be generic)
- finish phy
- test phy with model and on board with ADI prbs checker(PRBS7, PRBS15 or PRBS31)
- find SPI configuration for our design (map lanes correctly for KC705)
- implement link layer (try to be generic on supported data width: 16,32,64, 128?)
- implement transport layer (try to be generic on supported data width: 16,32,64, 128?)
- test transport/link/phy with model
- test link establishment with ADI device and ILAS (reponse to SYNC)
- test samples mapping to lanes with short test pattern and specific registers on ADI chip
- implement real example design (with artiq phaser) and test it on board
