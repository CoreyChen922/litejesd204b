- fix phy clocking/compare GTX parameters with reference design from Xilinx.
- fix Align Inserter Model
- find SPI configuration for our design (map lanes correctly for KC705)
- test phy on board with ADI prbs checker(PRBS7, PRBS15 or PRBS31), lower speed first, then up to 12.5Gbps.
- test link establishment with ADI device and ILAS (reponse to SYNC)
- test samples mapping to lanes with short test pattern and specific registers on ADI chip
- implement real example design (with artiq phaser) and test it on board
