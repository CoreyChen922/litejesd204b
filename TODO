- test scrambler.
- test transport layer (byte ordering).
- add elastic buffers between transport layer and links.
- add QPLL support on transceiver for linerate > 6.6Gbps.
- add deterministic latency.
- (optional) test PRBS generators and use them (we are currently using PRBS generators from the transceivers).
