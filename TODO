Global:
- regroup jesd lanes in buses
- (later) add deterministic latency.
- (optional) test PRBS generators and use them (we are currently using PRBS generators from the transceivers).

Kintex 7:
- fix transceiver initialization for high linerates.

Kintex Ultrascale:
- fix transceiver initialization.
- test with 8 lanes.
